## install Ansible Tower
## installation of Tower is to be done on the VM that has 8GB RAM, 2vCPUs.(This can be altered as well by a simple work around)

## 1)Installing the Ansible Tower automation platform needs to have the ansible-core automation engine already installed. 
##So, let’s install Ansible-core first.

$ ansible --version

## if Ansible is not installed, install it by following the steps prompted on the screen.

$ ansible --version

## 2)Let’s install the pre-requisites, rsync, wget

$ sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
$ sudo dnf install rsync wget -y
$ sudo dnf update -y
$ sudo dnf install ansible -y

## Check the python interpreter version.

$ python -V

## if you get error accessing the python binary, set the symlink with the correct python version binary.

$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.11 /usr/bin/python

## try running the version command after setting the symlink.
$ python -V

## update the hosts file located at /etc/hosts. Add the hosts entry with related IP address and FQDN of localhost server.

$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 aap.example.com aap
<internal-IP-address> aap.example.com aap

## set hostname for the server

$ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname aap.example.com
$ hostname
$ sudo reboot

## after the system is rebooted login and check the hostname .
